( Subset of Forth94 )

The bootstrapping process uses a metacompiler written in Lisp to
target a small inner interpreter and a handful of code words written
in C.  There is also a new metacompiler written in Forth which is
intended to replace the Lisp version in the future.  Work is under way
to add a real target using assembly language code words.

( Implementation guide )

The Forth kernel contains everything needed to read and compile the
rest of the system from source code, and not much else.  It's composed
of two parts: a target-specific file nucleus.fth containing all
primitive CODE words, and a target-independent kernel.fth.  These two
are compiled by the metacompiler.

When the kernel starts, it jumps to the word called WARM.  This is
responsible for loading the rest of the system and entering the text
interpreter.
