To build, type "make".  This will first build the bootstrap Forth by
metacompiling the kernel for the C target, and then call gcc to
generate an executable which runs under Linux, MacOS X, or Cygwin.

The bootstrap metacompiler is written in Lisp.  An attempt is made to
automatically detect an implementation, but if that fails you will
have to provide some assistance.  Currently, CLISP, Clozure CL, ECL,
and SBCL are supported.

After the bootstrap Forth has been built, it will rebuild itself using
the Forth metacompiler.  Subsequent build will skip the bootstrap
stage.
