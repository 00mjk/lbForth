To build the bootstrap Forth, type "make".  This will metacompile the
kernel for the C target, then call gcc to generate an executable which
runs under Linux, MacOS X, or Cygwin.

The bootstrap metacompiler is written in Lisp.  An attempt is made to
automatically detect an implementation, but if that fails you will
have to provide some assistance.  Currently, CLISP, Clozure CL, ECL,
and SBCL are supported.
